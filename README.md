## Social Network Analysis

### Objectives:
This project creates a social network analysis tool using an adjacency list to
model 250 users and their connections. Key features include friend suggestions
based on mutual connections, calculating degree of separation, identifying the top
5 strongly connected components, and evaluating user influence with centrality
measures. Additionally, the tool will provide basic network statistics like the
number of users, average connections, and the top 10 users with the most
connections. The code prioritizes readability, meaningful object names, and clear
comments for maintainability.
